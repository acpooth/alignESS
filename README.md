# alignESS

A program for Enzymatic Step Sequence (ESS) alignment using the Dynamic Programming (DP) Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm.

The program can perform the following alignments:

    pair                ESS command line pairwise comparisson using DP
    dbalign             ESSs database(s) alignment using DP
    multi               ESSs multiple alignment using GA

The pairwise alignments are generated with the DP algorithm, and the multiple ESS alignement is generated using a Genetic Algorithm (GA).

## Dependencies

The program runs in Python 3. It runs properly in an Anaconda base installation! (that includes numpy, sqlite, matplotlib, cython and pytest).

* Pair-wise alignment (simple pairwise or database alignment):
    - cython
    - numpy
	- sqlite3
    - matplotlib [optional] only for ecs_entropy.py script
	- pytest [optional] for running test suite

* Multiple alignment:
    - C boost library: only for compiling the alignment algorithm*
 
(*) This repo contains a compiled (linux 64 bit) copy of the multiple alignment algorithm that may work fine in
 the majority of linux systems. The source code of this part of the program is not yet included.
 
For convenience a conda environment can be build to fullfill all dependencies with the  conda .yml file in this repo

``` Bash
$ conda create env -f conda_env.yml
```

## Installing

For now, clone this git repository and use the alginESS.py script.


## Usage.

### Enzimatic Step Sequences (ESS)

The ESSs represent lineal consecutive steps of enzymatic activities. These steps are represented using the
Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers that describe catalytic function. Thus, the ESS are a form of functional representation
of a metabolic processes. In this case, only the first 3 numbers are considered, because in general seems to be
more informative and tends to be less prone to annotation issues.

The ESS can be obtained in any way, but must have the following form:

    1. Each enzime is represented by a 3 digit EC number: 3.1.4. 
	   Invalid numbers (i.e. inexistent in KEGG database) will rise error.
	2. The sequence (ESS) is constructed joining the enzimes using colons (:).
	   In this form (a 3 step ESS): 3.2.4:1.6.12:4.4.1
	3. An undetermined enzymatic setp must be specified in this form: 9.9.9

The program accepts ESS written on the terminal, in a text file or in a Sqlite database. Examples of each
type of file can be found in the test folder in this repo.



### Pair-wise alignment.

     usage: alignESS.py pair [-h] [-l] ess1 ess2
     positional arguments:
       ess1            ESS (3 levels EC numbers). Colon separated.
                       (1.2.3:3.5.-:...:9.9.9)
       ess2            ESS (3 levels EC numbers). Colon separated.
                       (1.2.3:3.5.-:...:9.9.9)
     
     optional arguments:
       -h, --help      show this help message and exit
       -l, --localize  The alignment is trimmed to the coverage of the shortest ESS
                       and the score is then calculated to the trimmed alignment.
                       This method allows to find 'local-like' alignments between
                       ESS of different size

ess1 and ess2 must be ESS written in the command line.

#### Example

``` Bash
(ess-env) $ python3 alignESS.py pair 2.7.1:5.3.1:5.3.1:2.7.1:4.1.2:1.2.1 5.3.1:5.3.1:4.2.1
```
Output
``` Bash
ess1:	2.7.1:5.3.1:5.3.1:2.7.1:4.1.2:1.2.1
ess2:	-.-.-:5.3.1:5.3.1:-.-.-:4.2.1:-.-.-
score = 0.566987156867981
>>> Done!!! <<<
:D, see you soon.
``` 

### Pair-wise database alginment.

     usage: alignESS.py dbalign [-h] [-db2 ESSDB2] [-o OUTFILE] [-t THRESHOLD]
                                [-nproc NPROC] [-l] [-align]
                                essdb1
     
     positional arguments:
       essdb1                ESSs database 1. Sqlite3 file with nrseqs table or
                             text file with one ESS in each line. If the essdb2
                             argument is not specified, the program performs the
                             all-vs-all alignment in essdb1. This argument also can
                             be a single ESS, in this case the -db2 argument is
                             necessary
     
     optional arguments:
       -h, --help            show this help message and exit
       -db2 ESSDB2, --essdb2 ESSDB2
                             ESSs databse 2. Sqlite3 file with nrseqs table or text
                             file with one ESS in each line
       -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                             Outfile name to report scores. By default the file
                             only contains the id of the ESSs and the score of the
                             alignment. If argument '-align' is set, then the file
                             contains the alignmed ESSs
       -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                             Threshold score to filter results in the range 0-1
                             [0.3]. If the threshold is high (>0.6) and the
                             databases are large, results may saturate the RAM
                             memmory, beware!
       -nproc NPROC          Number of processes to execute analysis [2]. It can be
                             created more processes than cores in the the
                             processor, so the speedup of the analysis depends on
                             the number of cores available
       -l, --localize        The alignment is trimmed to the coverage of the
                             shortest ESS and the score is then calculated to the
                             trimmed alignment. This method allows to find 'local-
                             like' alignments between ESS of different size
       -align                If set, the outputfile contains the alignment of each
                             ESS pair bellow the threshold. Beware, if the
                             databases are large and the threshold high, the file
                             may be huge or the RAM memmory colapse.

essdb1, essdb2 can be text files or sqlite databases (with specific format --coming soon--). Examples
can be found in test folder

#### Example

``` Bash
(ess-env) $  python3 alignESS.py dbalign tests/nr_part.db

```
Output
``` Bash
------ Opening databases:
tests/nr_part.db ( sqlite )
------ Aligning the database with itself (all vs all)...

### Multiple alignment

     usage: alignESS.py multi [-h] [-o OUTPUTFILE] [-p FILENAME] FILENAME
     
     positional arguments:
       FILENAME              ESSs file. Each line must contain an ESS name and the
                             ESS separeated by a TAB. Accepts commentaries with '#'
     
     optional arguments:
       -h, --help            show this help message and exit
       -o OUTPUTFILE, --multiout OUTPUTFILE
                             Multiple alignment outputfile
       -p FILENAME, --pcomp FILENAME
                             If spificied, stores the pairwise comparisson of the
                             ESSs in the ESSs file
     
File name must be a text file. An example can be found in test folder.

### Updating the EC scoring matrix for pairwise alignment.

The scoring (dissimilarity) matrix used by the pairwise alignment program can be updated
using the script ecs_entropy.py. This script creates the matrix on a python binary file,
however, the program can also store the matrix in text format and plot it in a *png* file.

In order to create the matrix, first is necessary to download the KEGG EC number list from
this URL: [http://rest.kegg.jp/list/ec](http://rest.kegg.jp/list/ec)

    usage: ecs_entropy.py [-h] [-s npz|txt] [-p] ecfile
    
    Create an entropy based similarity (distance) matrix for EC alignment. The similarity is
    calculated for the first 3 levels of EC classification
    
    positional arguments:
      ecfile                KEGG EC numbers list. This file can be downloaded with this link:
                            http://rest.kegg.jp/list/ec
    
    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -s npz|txt, --store-format npz|txt
                            Output file format. The default (npz) format is as numpy binary file
                            that can be used by the ESS alignment program. txt option gets a
                            tabular separated text file
      -p, --plot            Plot the matrix in ent_matrix.png file
